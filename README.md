# Least Squares Method

This very simple program was written in C++ to calculate method of least squares (regression analysis).
It's based on main matrix class to estimate line regresion of inputed data.

## IDE

This little project has been built with [NetBeans IDE 7.4](https://netbeans.org/).


## Matrix Class Api

Features:

  - Overwrite minor group of operators `()`, `=`, `+`, `+=`, `-`, `-=`, `<<`, `*`, `^`,
  - Add some specyfic function to the class Matrix like `transpose` or `determinant`,
  - Add some helper functions to glue all friend and build-in functions together, like:
    * isEvenNumber
    * isNegativeNumber
    * highestValue
    * isMatrixSizeEqual
    * etc ;)

What more TODO:

  - To improve creating objects, constructor can be overwritten in ex: A("1,2;3,4;5,6;") and it should create matrix A with dimension of 3x2 and filled cells with data. Some scratch of implementation is all ready and put in the comments in the class Matrix.

## Tests
Minor and simple tests of basic functions and Least Square Method are all ready written in main file.
